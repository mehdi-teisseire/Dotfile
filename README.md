This repository contains my personal configuration files for [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), the dynamic tiling Wayland compositor.

## 📁 What's Included

These are just my backup config files. The repo includes:

- `~/.config/hypr/` – Hyprland main config

- `~/.config/rofi/` – Rofi launcher/theme
- `~/.config/kitty/` – Kitty terminal settings
- `~/.config/wlogout/` – Wlogout config

## 💡 Note

These files are **not meant to be installed directly**. They are here for backup/reference purposes only. Feel free to explore or adapt parts of it to your own setup.

- Waybar
- Rofi

- A Wayland-compatible system (e.g., Arch Linux with `wlroots`)
